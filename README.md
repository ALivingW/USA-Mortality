MORTALITY-IN-USA

Using Numpy and Pandas, i analysed the given data, by grouping data of different regions of the USA and analysed them separately based on the causes of death in each region. After obtaining this data, I used matplotlib to draw the appropriate graphs to display the data. 
Although line graphs are more appropriate for variable-time graphs, I wanted to have a crack at it!
